<p>When you cook, you go through certain steps in a consistent order. You figure out which ingredients you need, you gather them, you prep them, and finally you cook them and present your finished dish.</p>

<p>Creating a data visualization is a lot like cooking. You decide what data you need, you collect it, you prepare and clean it for use, and then you make the visualization and present your finished result.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re cooking, it helps to understand what each ingredient does so you know what you can do with it. For example, salt and sugar look similar but achieve very different results!</p>

<p>In this section, we&rsquo;ll talk about what the basic ingredient groups of data are and what can and can&rsquo;t be done with them so you have a sense of how to properly work with them later on.</p>
